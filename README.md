# AltAz-SkyTracker-Arduino
This Project was created with the goal of building an Arduino based Go-To/SkyTracker for the Skywatcher 200p Telescope. Since it uses an Alt-Az mount, traditional Skytracker will not work


Features:
- Motorized Go-To System with various Sky-Objectes to choose from the databank
- Automated skytracking

**Hardware Requirement**:
- Arduino (model at the moment unknown)
- 2 NEMA23 stepper motor
- 2 Tb6000 motor driver
- GPS module
- 2 Hall effect sensor
